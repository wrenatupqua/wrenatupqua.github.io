Wren Atupqua Ruiz is a Colombian-American artist born in Miami, Florida, and raised in the nearby community of Hialeah. They currently reside in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Wren is a self-taught artist who seeks to resurface and transform emotional and somatic experiences of unease with capitalist-patriarchal norms embedded in Latin-American culture. Their largely figurative artworks are influenced by surrealism and magic realism. Wren uses these genres to refer to imagination as escapism from relational disconnection as well as a mechanism for self-dissociation. Embodying poses born from memories, family photographs, and childhood fantasies assists in recalling the felt sense of these experiences.
